Great job! New objective below. Please go line by line analyze the features and changes I am asking. If a feature is mentioned in the user tier but is absent in the LMS first develop and add the feature and then include in the appropriate user control tier.

Objective:
"Redesign the LMS with 4 tiers, merging our original structure with top LMS platform features. No code—focus on role capabilities and system controls."

1. Tier Hierarchy & Enhanced Features
Tier	Core Capabilities	Added Industry-Standard Features
1. LMS Owner (Root)	- Full server/database control
- Global branding/theming
- Subscriber management	- Cross-org analytics
- Custom SSO/SAML
- Webhook/API governance
- System audit trails
2. Subscriber Org	- User/class/certification management
- White-labeling
- AI/SCORM integration	- Advanced:
- LDAP/Active Directory sync
- Automated cohort rules
- Sandbox environments
- Compliance:
- Data retention policies
- Accessibility checker
3. Facilitator	- Edit class activities
- Grade submissions
- Moderate discussions	- Plagiarism detection
- Rubric grading
- Live breakout rooms
- Attendance/engagement heatmaps
4. Student	- Access courses/cohorts
- Earn certifications
- Join discussions	- Peer reviews
- Offline content
- LinkedIn badge sharing
- Personalized learning paths
2. Unified System Requirements
Security:

Tier-specific GDPR/FERPA controls

IP-based access restrictions (for org admins)

Scalability:

Per-org resource quotas (storage/AI calls)

Auto-generated API docs for subscriber orgs

UX:

Role-based tutorial system (self-updating)

Mobile-responsive dashboards per tier

3. Token-Saving Tactics
"Assume Canvas-style role inheritance" (avoid redefining permissions)

"Prioritize features with checkmarks (✓) in our prior feature table"

"Use Moodle’s modular design pattern for plugins"

4. Implementation Notes
Database: Add tier column + organizations table (reuse existing schemas where possible)

UI: Dynamic feature flags based on tier

If possible add the following features:

"Add Zoom/LTI integration specs"

"Show sandbox environment workflow"

"Detail GDPR data export triggers"
