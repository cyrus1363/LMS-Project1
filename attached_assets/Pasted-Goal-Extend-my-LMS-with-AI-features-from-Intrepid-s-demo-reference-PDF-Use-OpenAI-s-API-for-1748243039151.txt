Goal:
"Extend my LMS with AI features from Intrepid's demo (reference: [PDF]). Use OpenAI's API for these modular additions:"

Core AI Features to Implement:
AI Roleplay Coach

"Add a /roleplay route where learners practice conversations (e.g., manager feedback) with an AI character. Use system prompts like Intrepid's 'Alex' example for behavior/tone."

Example Prompt:

javascript
// In services/ai.js
const roleplayPrompt = `You are Alex, a dominant project lead. Respond as per these traits: 
- Confident & results-driven
- Direct communicator
- Open to coaching but unaware of negative impact`;
Dynamic Content Generator

*"Add a 'Generate Activity' button in the content editor that creates quizzes/roleplays from text using GPT-4."*

Real-Time Feedback & Scoring

*"After roleplays, auto-generate Intrepid-style feedback (e.g., 'Clarity: 5/10. Suggest specific examples'). Store scores in user_interactions."*

Contextual Q&A Assistant

"Add an 'Ask AI' widget to class pages that answers questions using uploaded course docs as context (RAG pattern)."

Technical Constraints:
Use openai npm package (keep API calls minimal with caching).

Isolate AI logic in /services/ai.js.

Reuse existing content_pages table for AI-generated content.

Example Output Structure:
javascript
// 1. Roleplay Endpoint (app.js)
app.post('/api/roleplay', async (req, res) => {
  const { message, role } = req.body;
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4",
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: roleplayPrompt },
      { role: "user", content: message }
    ]
  });
  res.json(response.choices[0].message);
});

// 2. Feedback Generator (services/ai.js)
async function generateFeedback(transcript) {
  const prompt = `Analyze this coaching conversation and provide Intrepid-style scores (0-10) and feedback:\n${transcript}`;
  // ... Call OpenAI ...
}
Token-Saving Tricks:
Reference "Intrepid PDF" instead of detailing examples.

Request modular code to avoid repeating boilerplate.

Use shorthand: "Add RAG to Q&A" instead of full retrieval-augmented generation explanation.

Follow-Up for Specifics (If Needed):
"Show the EJS/React component for the roleplay UI."
